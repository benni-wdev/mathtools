# mathtools
Math package basically inspired by things i did on university. I made it a little bit nicer for publishing it here.
It will be extended over time with some stuff i have still in the backlog + new stuff i develop because of other projects.

Currently it contains:

- a vector package including Implementations of Matrix and Vector with alot of operations on these entitiies.
- a prime package with prime test algorithms
- a function  package where at the moment only polynomials are implemented including polynomial interpolation.
