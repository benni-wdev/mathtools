# mathtools
Math package basically inspired by things i did at university. I made it a little bit nicer for publishing it here.
It will be extended over time with some stuff i have still in the backlog + new stuff i develop because of other projects.

Currently it contains:

- a vector package including Implementations of Matrix and Vector with alot of operations on these entitiies.
-- Basic immutable Type implementation of Matrix and Vector, Matrix multiplication, addition, Vector addition, scalar products ...
- a prime package with prime test algorithms
-- Miller Rabin Test, Fermat Test, Greatest Common Divisor algorithms
-- PrimeSequence generators (Sieve of Eratosthenes, Sieve of Sundaram)
-- Factorization algorithms (byDivision, Fermat)
- a function  package where at the moment only polynomials are implemented including polynomial interpolation.
-- Basic immutable Type implementation of polynomials, multiply, add, substract, agrange Interpolation, Newton Interpolation ...


In the backlog:

- graph package
- linear equation solving
- linear optimization
